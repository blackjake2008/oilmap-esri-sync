Unzip arcgisruntime10.2.5.zip and place folder in:

\\Application Files\RPS_ARCGIS_SCENARIO_MANAGER_1_0_0_11

Run the exe installer.

If this doesn't work, remove the ".deploy" extenstion the for the files in this folder:
\\Application Files\RPS_ARCGIS_SCENARIO_MANAGER_1_0_0_11

The RPS_ARCGIS_SCENARIO_MANAGER.exe file should open a GUI that lists all scenarios in the defined service.
